			Exploratory Data Analysis

			You can access an interactive form of the visualizations below<a href="https://g10ria.github.io/c35_tod/">here</a>! It depicts 
			housing developments completed in Somerville over the past 20 years; the size of the circle corresponds to the number of 
			family units added.
		</p>
		<p style="white-space: pre-line;">
			The two datasets I used are:
			1. MassBuilds real estate developments in Somerville from 2005 to 2025
			2. MBTA GTFS route geoJSON data
		</p>
		<p>
			I decided to focus specifically on Somerville for this assignment, partly to limit the amount of data that I had to work with.
			I also thought it could be interesting because Somerville is highly residential, containing many single family homes still.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first dataset includes a crowdsourced list of development projects in Massachusetts from online website MassBuilds. Volunteers can add data points, 
			including info such as the number of single family and multi family units, the developer's name, the height and area, etc.;
			a full glossary of the data columns can be found at https://www.massbuilds.com/glossary. To ensure data simplicity and quality,
			I only plotted developments that were labeled as completed, provided a year, and had their "stalled" flag set to false. Additionally,
			for outliers (e.g. adding a very high volume of family units), I manually searched them up and matched them to 
			publicly available developers' documents (e.g. the $465 Partners Healthcare Assembly Row development, which added 2000 parking spots).
		</p>
		<p>
			The second dataset includes geoJSON data of MBTA bus routes, as of 2024.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides these two datasets, I also used a geoJSON polygon file provided by the city of Somerville 
			delineating the city's boundaries, so that I could draw them on the map.

			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Developmenr</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>In the past 20 years in Somerville, at what density have new housing developments been built, and where?</li>
				<ul>
					First, I wanted to visualize where developers have tended to build projects in the past 20 years (since 2005),
					and how many family units were included in each developments. I wanted to see if there were specific areas that 
					have seen high levels of development for some reason, if high-magnitude development is the norm or the outlier,
					and if developments tend to cluster together, either near roads or in particular districts.
				</ul>
				<li>For those same developments, where are they located in relation to public transit arteries, and how has this changed over time?</li>
				<ul>
					Building on my visualization from the first question, I wanted to add a layer depicting the MBTA bus network.
					I was curious to see how new developments were located relative to bus routes, and I also wanted to see how
					this relationship differed throughout the years (e.g. for developments in 2010 vs. 2020), adding a time dimension.
				</ul>
				<li>Which developments added new parking spots as part of their project, and how many?</li>
				<ul>
					For this question, I was inspired by one of our readings from 11.001 (Sara Bronin, Key to the City): 
					"...parking [zoning] requirements have created decentralized, privately funded infrastructure that facilitates 
					driving." (ch. 6) I was interested in seeing which developments added new parking spots to their projects and 
					where they tended to be located. I hypothesized that developments with very large numbers of units would have 
					added many parking spots (possibly because they were required to by zoning restrictions), while smaller-scale 
					developments wouldn't have added any (likely due to the ability of street parking to satisfy their needs).
				</ul>

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
					Construction developments in Somerville completed within the past 20 years (between 2005 to 2025, inclusive).
					The size of each circle is proportional to the amount of family units in the development; this quantity
					ranges from 1 to 500 for this specific dataset. Note that the size of the circle does not refer to the physical 
					area covered by the development; rather, it denotes the "impact" of the development in terms of how many people 
					it is able to house. We glean some interesting insights from this map: first,
					there is a concentration of high-volume development in the Northeast corner of Somerville, facing the Charles River.
					Inspecting the data reveals that this is the Assembly Row area. It is somewhat closed off from the rest of the city,
					with highway 93 on the left and railroad tracks on the right, but has its own T station, and is mixed use,
					with many large retailers on-location. Besides Assembly Row, there are also two more notable high-density development
					areas: one right next to Union Square (bottom middle) and a few right next to Magoun Square (in the middle, slightly up and to the left).

				<img src="./images/2005_2015.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Construction developments in Somerville completed between 2005 and 2015, inclusive. As previously,
					the size of each circle is proportional to the amount of family units in the development. The yellow lines depict 
					the MBTA bus and subway network in Somerville; deeper yellows indicate that multiple bus lines travel through that road. 
					First, to extract some surface level observations, we see that transit routes tend to fan out radially from the Charles River 
					side of Somerville, following existing large roads; in the middle of Somerville, there are no bus routes that cross the city
					"perpendicularly". A note is that Somerville Rail Trail also runs directly down the long axis of Somerville; although it 
					does not contain motorized transit like buses, it is potentially an important component of transit for bikers, scooter riders, etc.
					(More analysis in the next image's caption, as these two come as a set)

				<img src="./images/2016_2025.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Construction developments in Somerville completed between 2016 and 2025, inclusive. From the last image to this one, we see 
					some interesting developments. We saw the seeds of Assembly Row being planted in the previous map, with three mid-sized
					developments; in this one, we see them sprout into much more high volume developments. However, the overall number of developments
					has decreased drastically. It does seem that all of the later developments tended to be closer to the public transit networks
					(within the highlighted yellow zones), whereas the earlier ones were scattered in many of the in-between areas. This could be due 
					to the fact that newer transit lines weren't added until later--the MBTA data I'm depicting is from 2024 only, so I'm unable to 
					visualize the whole time dimension properly. One more note is that we see the transit bus lines encircling Assembly Row; I would
					argue that having easy access to public transit in that area is a big reason that developers are willing to bet on big projects there.

				<img src="./images/allyears_parkingonly.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Construction developments in Somerville THAT ADDED PARKING, completed between 2005 and 2025, inclusive. The radius of each circle 
					is proportional to the number of parking spots added by that development project, up to a max of 2000.
					Following up from the last two questions, I wanted to explore the question of parking. We don't immediately think about parking when we 
					think about housing, but it is oftentimes a quiet, insidious reason that developers don't favor 
					high-density or transit-oriented development. When zoning requirements mandate a certain ratio of parking spots to units,
					developers are more inclined to build low-density, expensive apartments, so they don't have to incur the costs of
					building parking structures or giving up valuable surface area. This visualization confirms my hypothesis that the 
					high-volume developments in Assembly Row would have added lots of parking. Inspecting the dataset also reveals that the 
					development at Union Square added 300 units of parking (unspecified type). Next, adding the time dimension back in...

				<figcaption>
					Construction developments in Somerville THAT ADDED PARKING, completed between 2016 and 2025, inclusive. These two images reveal
					that a much greater percentage of developments in 2016-2025 added parking as compared to 2005-2015. Although the difference 
					doesn't look that large visually, we must remember that were about 3x as many developments completed between 2005-2015 in the first place. 
					The most notable parking projects are again Assembly Row, but we see many smaller developments adding parking here and there, on the 
					order of 100 or less parking spots.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				For this assignment, I was primarily interested in working with map data, because I wanted to extract spatial conclusions 
				from my data. I struggled a lot with how to process the map data properly; originally, I was using
				OpenStreetMaps, but I had a hard time changing the configuration opens when visualizing using Cartagen. It also took me 
				a while to write a script to pick out Somerville-specific or Boston-specific data from the .osm file; the smallest map data 
				file contained the entirety of the US Northeast. After that, I pivoted to using the MapLibre library instead, which has a much 
				better documented API but less flexibility with importing custom data.
				I feel like I could have explored some research questions further, but I didn't have time because it took me a while to wrangle the 
				map data. However, I feel confident going into the next assignments (and the final project) that I can make more interactive 
				and complex visualizations.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the actual research questions, I included most of my analyses in the captions, but I feel like overall, I was able to 
				understand the MassBuilds dataset a lot better. Developments tend to be smaller-scale, with only a few projects building more than 200 housing 
				units at a time. Assembly Row is very central in the development story of Somerville, especially in the past 10 years; the highest-volume 
				buildings and the largest parking structure have been erected there. The number of distinct completed developments has decreased drastically between 
				2016-2025 when compared to 2005-2015; I'm not exactly sure why. It could be that there are fewer available parcels for development, that COVID heavily 
				slowed down the last five years of development, or some other reason entirely. More recent developments seem to be located closer to 
				the MBTA bus network; yet at the same time, they're much more likely to add parking. (A quick Google search revealed that 
				Somerville parking requirements were just removed by the City Council last December, so this might change going forward.)
			</p>
			<p>
				One shortcoming is that I think should have plotted Cambridge development data as well, given how 
				closely entwined it is with Somerville. For example, some of the data on the Southern border of Somerville is kind of deceptive, since 
				it lies right next to Beacon Street; I'm sure that if Cambridge developments were plotted as well, there would be a lot more 
				circles clumped up around there as it's a main artery street.
